
# COMMIT 1:
 
## This is commit 1, In this commit I created all the necessary files and designed file structure & planning for the project.
## Files created 
1. README.md
2. stats.c
3. stats.h

## File Description
1. README.md contains all the information of project 
2. stats.c file contains all the source code
3. stats.h file contains function declarations of functions that are declared in stats.c file

## Plan
1. stats.c includes header file(stats.h) to connect with it.
2. stats.h just declares(not defines) all the subroutine functions inside stats.c
3. So compiling stats.h from stats.c enables main function from stats.c to use subroutine functions via stats.h even if no function prototpes used in stats.c
